# Dynamic Component Loader

This simple project was made only for learning purposes.
I've seen a few implementations before, but most articles are outdated.

There is also an example with **Input()** and **Output()**. 
And yes i know, CSS files are far from good, but that's not the point.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.

## Running
Not a big deal. ```npm install``` and ```npm start```.
